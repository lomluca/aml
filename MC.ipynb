    "# Estimating Financial Risk through Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "Risk analysis is part of every decision we make when faced with uncertainty, ambiguity, and variability. Indeed, even though we have unprecedented access to information, we can't accurately predict the future. In finance, there is a fair amount of uncertainty and risk involved with estimating the future value of financial products, due to the wide variety of potential outcomes. Monte Carlo simulation (also known as the Monte Carlo Method) allows inspecting many possible outcomes of the decision making process, and can be used to assess the impact of risk: this, in turns, allows for better decision-making under uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "The main objectives we set for this Notebook are as follows:\n",
    "1. Develop fundamental knowledge about Risk analysis\n",
    "2. Understand Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)\n",
    "3. Apply Monte Carlo Simulation for predicting risk\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "1. First, in section 1, we introduce the basics of MCS\n",
    "2. In section 2, we work on a simple example to where we apply the MCS method\n",
    "3. In section 3, we briefly summarize the main characteristics of the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique\n",
    "4. In section 4, we overview the common distributions which are often used in MCS\n",
    "5. In section 5, we work on a real use case, that focuses on estimating financial risk. We will use techniques such as featurization  (that is, generating additional features to improve model accuracy), linear regression, kernel density estimation, sampling distributions and so on ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reference\n",
    "This Notebook is inspired by Chapter 9 of the book [Advanced Analytics with Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do) by Josh Wills, Sandy Ryza, Sean Owen, and Uri Laserson. It is strongly suggested to read this Chapter to get a general idea of the topic of this Notebook.\n",

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that can be applied such that it is possible to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making. This technique is used in many different fields, such as R&D, risk management, portfolio management, pricing derivatives, strategic planning, project planning, cost modeling and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, MCS is a technique that \"converts\" uncertainty on input variables of a model into **probability distributions**. By combining the distributions and randomly selecting values from them, it recalculates the simulated model many times, to determine the probability of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, this technique was first used by scientists working on the atomic bomb: it was named after Monte Carlo, the Monaco resort town renowned for its casinos.  Since its introduction in World War II, Monte Carlo simulation has been used to model a variety of physical and conceptual systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. How does it work?\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation performs risk analysis by building models of possible results by *substituting a range of possible input values, that constitute uncertainty, into a statistical distribution*. It then computes possible outcomes repeatedly, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions that \"model\" the input. Depending upon the number of random input variables and their distribution, a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of \"rounds\" before it is complete. When complete, *Monte Carlo simulation produces distributions of possible outcome values*.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using probability distributions instead of actual input samples, it is possible to model more accurately uncertainty: different choices of distributions will yield different outputs."

    "# 2. Illustrative example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are the marketing manager for a firm that is planning to introduce a new product. You need to estimate the first-year net profit from this product, which might depend on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sales volume in units\n",
    "- Price per unit (also called \"Selling price\")\n",
    "- Unit cost\n",
    "- Fixed costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Net profit will be calculated as $Net Profit = Sales Volume* (Selling Price - Unit cost) - Fixed costs$.  Fixed costs (accounting for various overheads, advertising budget, etc.) are known to be \\$ 120,000, which we assume to be deterministic. All other factors, instead, involve some uncertainty: *sales volume* (in units) can cover quite a large range, the *selling price* per unit will depend on competitor actions, which are hard to predict, and *unit costs* will also vary depending on vendor prices and production experience, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to build a risk analysis model, we must first identify the uncertain variables -- which are essentially random variables.  While there's some uncertainty in almost all variables in a business model, we want to focus on variables where the range of values is significant."

    "As discussed before, the selling price and selling volume both depend on the state of the market scenario (slow/normal/hot). So, the net profit is the result of two random variables: `market scenario` (which in turn determines `sales volumes` and `selling price`) and `unit cost`.\n",

Then, we can compute directly the values for selling price and selling volumes based on the outcome of the random variable `market scenario`, as shown in Section 2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these a-priori distributions, in each run (or trial) of our Monte Carlo simulation, we can generate the sample value for each random variable and use it to calculate the Net Profit. The more simulation runs, the more accurate our results will be. For example, if we run the simulation 100,000 times, the average net profit will amount to roughly \\$92,600. Every time we run the simulation, a different prediction will be output: the average of such predictions will consistently be less than \\$117,500, which we predicted using averages only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that in this simple example, we generate values for the `market scenario` and `unit cost` independently: we consider them to be **independent random variables**. This means that the eventual (and realistic!) correlation between the `market scenario` and `unit cost` variables is ignored. Later, we will learn how to be more precise and account for dependency between random variables.\n"

In other words, values \"near\" the mean are most likely to occur.  This is symmetric distribution, and it is not bounded in its co-domain. It is very often used to  describe **natural phenomena, such as people’s heights, inflation rates, energy prices**, and so on and so forth. An illustration of a normal distribution is given below:\n",

Values are positively skewed, not symmetric like a normal distribution.  Examples of variables described by some lognormal distributions include, for example, **real estate property values, stock prices, and oil reserves**. An illustration of a lognormal distribution is given below:\n",

    "- ***Triangular Distribution***: this is a continuous distribution with fixed minimum and maximum values. It is bounded by the minimum and maximum values and can be either symmetrical (the most probable value = mean = median) or asymmetrical. Values around the most likely value (e.g. the mean) are more likely to occur.  Variables that could be described by a triangular distribution include, for example, **past sales history per unit of time and inventory levels**.

Examples of variables that can be described by a uniform distribution include **manufacturing costs or future sales revenues for a new product**. An illustration of the uniform distribution is given below:\n",

    "We hope that by now you have a good understanding about Monte Carlo simulation. Next, we apply this method to a real use case: *financial risk estimation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are an investor on the stock market. You plan to buy some stocks and you want to estimate the maximum loss you could incur after two weeks of investing. This is the quantity that the financial statistic \"Value at Risk\" (VaR) seeks to measure. [VaR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk) is defined as a measure of investment risk that can be used as a reasonable estimate of the maximum probable loss for a value of an investment portfolio, over a particular time period. A VaR statistic depends on three parameters: a portfolio, a time period, and a confidence level. A VaR of 1 million dollars with a 95% confidence level over two weeks, indicates the belief that the portfolio stands only a 5% chance of losing more than 1 million dollars over two weeks. VaR has seen widespread use across financial services organizations. This statistic plays a vital role in determining how much cash investors must hold to meet the credit ratings that they seek. In addition, it is also used to understand the risk characteristics of large portfolios: it is a good idea to compute the VaR before executing trades, such that it can help take informed decisions about investments. \n",

    "- **Return**: The change in an instrument or portfolio’s value over a time period. \n",

    "- **Index**: An imaginary portfolio of instruments. For example, the NASDAQ Composite index includes about 3,000 stocks and similar instruments for major US and international companies. \n",

    "### Step 2: Defining the distributions for the market conditions\n",
    "Since we cannot define the distributions for the market factors directly, we can only approximate their distribution.\n",
    "The best way to do that, is plotting their value. However, these values may fluctuate quite a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we show how to use the Kernel density estimation (KDE) technique to approximate such distributions. In brief, kernel density estimation is a way of smoothing out a histogram: this is achieved by assigning (or centering) a probability distribution (usually a normal distribution) to each data point, and then summing. So, a set of two-week-return samples would result in a large number of \"super-imposed\" normal distributions, each with a different mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the probability density at a given point, KDE evaluates the PDFs of all the normal distributions at that point and takes their average. The smoothness of a kernel density plot depends on its *bandwidth*, and the standard deviation of each of the normal distributions. For a brief introduction on KDE, please refer to this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation)."

    "### Step 5: Evaluating the results using backtesting method\n",
    "In general, the error in a Monte Carlo simulation should be proportional to 1/sqrt(n), where n is the number of trials. This means, for example, that quadrupling the number of trials should approximately cut the error in half. A good way to check the quality of a result is backtesting on historical data. Backtesting is a statistical procedure where actual losses are compared to the estimated VaR. For instance, if the confidence level used to calculate VaR is 95% (or VaR 5%), we expect only 5 failures over 100 two-week time windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common test of a VaR model is counting the number of VaR failures, i.e., in how many windows, the losses exceed VaR estimate. If the number of exceptions is less than selected confidence level would indicate, the VaR model overestimates the risk. On the contrary, if there are too many exceptions, the risk is underestimated. However, it's very hard to observe the amount of failures suggested by the confidence level exactly. Therefore, people try to study whether the number of failures is reasonable or not, or will the model be accepted or rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common test is Kupiec's proportion-of-failures (POF) test. This test considers how the portfolio performed at many historical time intervals and counts the number of times that the losses exceeded the VaR. The null hypothesis is that the VaR is reasonable, and a sufficiently extreme test statistic means that the VaR estimate does not accurately describe the data. The test statistic is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-2ln\\Bigg(\\frac{(1-p)^{T-x}p^x}{(1-\\frac{x}{T})^{T-x}(\\frac{x}{T})^x}\\Bigg)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p$ is the quantile-of-loss of the VaR calculation (e.g., in VaR 5%, p=0.05),\n",
    "\n",
    "$x$ (the number of failures) is the number of historical intervals over which the losses exceeded the VaR \n",
    "\n",
    "$T$ is  the total number of historical intervals considered\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume the null hypothesis that the VaR is reasonable, then this test statistic is drawn from a chi-squared distribution with a single degree of freedom. By using Chi-squared distribution, we can find the `p-value` accompanying our test statistic value.  If `p-value` exceeds the critical value of the Chi-squared distribution, we do have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the model is reasonable. Or we can say, in that case, the model is considered as inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assume that we calculate VaR 5% (the confidence level of the VaR model is 95%) and get value VaR = 2.26. We also observed 50 exceptions over 500 time windows. Using the formula above, the test statistic `p-value` is calculated and equal to `8.08`. Compared to `3.84`, the critical value of Chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom at probability 5%, the test statistic is larger. So, the model is rejected. The critical values of Chi-squared can be found by following [this link](https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/tbl-chi.html).\n",
    "However, in this Notebook, it's not a good idea to find the corresponding critical value by looking in a \"messy\" table, especially when we need to change the confidence level. Instead, from `p-value`, we will calculate the probability of the test statistic in Chi-square thanks to some functions in package `scipy`. If the calculated probability is smaller than the quantile of loss (e.g, 0.05), the model is rejected and vice versa.\n"

    "In this lecture, we studied the Monte Carlo Simulation method and its application to estimate financial risk. To apply it, first, we needed to define the relationship between market factors and the instruments' returns. In such step, you must define the model which maps the market factors' values to the instruments' values: in our use case, we used a linear regression function for building our model. Next, we also had to find the parameters of our model, which are the weights of the factors we considered. Then, we had to study the distribution of each market factor. A good way to do that is using Kernel density estimation to smooth the distribution and plot it. Depending on the shape of each figure, we had to guess the best fit distribution for each factor: in our use case, we used a very simple approach, and decided that our smoothed distributions all looked normal distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the idea of Monte Carlo simulation was to generate many possible values for each factor and calculate the corresponding outcomes by a well-defined model in each trial. After many trials, we were able to calculate VaR from the sequences of outcome's values. When the number of trials is large enough, the VaR converges to reasonable values, that we could validate using well-known statistical hypothesis. "
